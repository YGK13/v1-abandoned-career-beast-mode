# PDF Chapter Files Directory

This directory contains all the chapter PDFs for the Life Design Library books.

## Directory Structure
- Each volume has its own folder (volume-1, volume-2, etc.)
- Individual chapter PDFs are named with a consistent pattern: volume-{vol}-chapter-{chap}-{title}.pdf
- For example: volume-1-chapter-1-four-conversations.pdf

## Important
When processing the complete volume PDFs into individual chapters, maintain this naming convention
for proper file linking in the application.
